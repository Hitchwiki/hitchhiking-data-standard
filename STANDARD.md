| stops                | required  | list[stop]            | Space and time information to describe the ride. At least one item is required. The first item in the list marks the origin of the ride. If there is more than one item, then the last item marks the destination of the ride. For the destination no `departure_time` or `waiting_time` are allowed to be specified. If there are more than two items the items in between mark intermediate stops of the ride e.g. a break at a rest station.                                                                             |                |[{location: {latitude:52.3020268, longitude:13.0158591, is_exact: true}, arrival_time: 2025-06-05T11:05:54+02:00[Europe/Berlin], departure_time: 2025-06-05T12:05:54+02:00[Europe/Berlin], waiting_time: 60M}, {location: {latitude:52.2520882, longitude:12.29463, is_exact: true}, arrival_time: 2025-06-05T13:05:54+02:00[Europe/Berlin], departure_time: 2025-06-05T13:15:54+02:00[Europe/Berlin], waiting_time: 10M}, {location: {latitude:52.1257667, longitude:11.3303771, is_exact: true}, arrival_time: 2025-06-05T14:05:54+02:00[Europe/Berlin]}]
| rating          | recommended  | int                 | Very subjective rating of the spot where the ride started. From 1 (senseless to hitchhike there) to 5 (excellent for hitchhiking).                                                         | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5  |4           |
| hitchhikers          | required  | list[hitchhiker]        | Most often a description of a solo-hitchhiker but also caters for couples or groups of hitchhikers.

| signals               | optional  | list[signal]            | Information about the methods used to solicit the ride. List them in the order that they were used.
