# Standard for what and how to track hitchhiking rides

Applications which help hitchikers track their trips should rely one a common data format such that records of rides can be shared easily and be used for the benefit of all.

This standard should reflect the diversity of hitchhikers such that it allows shallow records from the average or beginner hitchhiker as well as very in-depth and almost customized records from [super-hitchhikers](https://prino.neocities.org/miscellaneous/keeping-statistics).

This data format should reflect a single ride via hitchhiking. Building up on this it will be possible to connect rides to trips, judge the "hichhikability" of certain frequently used spots as well as to gain deeper insights into state of hitchhiking.
